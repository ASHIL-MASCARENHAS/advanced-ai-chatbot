## üõ†Ô∏è Project Setup (Local)

- To run this project locally, follow these steps:

- Clone the Repository (or download the files):

```
git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git)
cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
```

- Get Your Gemini API Key:

- Go to Google AI Studio.

- Create a new API key.

- Create the config.js File:

- Rename config.example.js to config.js.

- Open config.js and paste your API key inside the quotes:

- const GEMINI_API_KEY = "PASTE_YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE";


## Run the Application:

- You cannot just open index.html directly in your browser due to security rules (CORS) for local files.

- You must serve it from a local web server. The easiest way is using the live-server VS Code extension or running a simple Python server:

### If you have Python 3
```python -m http.server```

- Then, open your browser and go to http://localhost:8000/. (It will automatically find index.html).

## üåê Deployment

- You can deploy this project as a static website on platforms like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.

- Important for Deployment: You cannot use the config.js file method for a deployed site, as it would be publicly visible. You must use the "Snippet Injection" method described in the Deployment_Guide.md file, which injects your API key as a secure environment variable.
